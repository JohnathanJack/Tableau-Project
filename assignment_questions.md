#### V) Causes of Death - Our World In Data: 

The Global Burden of Disease is a major global study on the causes of death and disease published in the medical journal The Lancet. These estimates of the annual number of deaths dataset are shown here. The dataset is available from the Kaggle website: [Cause of Death - Our World In Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data?resource=download).

1. Connect your data
2. Detect different data types in your data
3. Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset. 
4. This table has 36 different features. Can you detect the most important features ? Why do you think these are important? Can you define a question for yourself? Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends in them. In this dataset, every column has the same importance because it explains one of the conditions that leads to death. Your task is to identify the most important reasons of death (features) in all countries as well as within each country.
5. In your final project you should show visualizations with:
  - Maps
  - Date and time
  - Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering)
  - Show Me tables
6. Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps.
7. From step 5, try to detect meaningful keypoints. This is the starting point to think about your dashboard. 
8. Now that you are familiar with your dataset and your columns, in this step, come up with different questions which you will be answering and presenting at the end of this project.
9. Create the dashboard to answer your questions that you came up with in step 8 and try to revise your questions along the way.
10. Get ready to present your dashboard.





BIG Question: What is the main cause of death throughout history? 
-> Cardiovascular diseases holds a significant number of deaths
-> Neoplasm (cancer) is second highest 
-> Upon removal, seen that HEALTH related deaths are the main source of deaths through history
-> Highest number of deaths not due to health is road injuries

WHERE are all these deaths occuring???
China has the largest amount of deaths compared to every other country -> most likely due to their highly dense population
India comes second for a majority of deaths



Important Features
-Health related diseases, Year, Country
Outliers:
Cardiovascular and neoplasm deaths increasing large amounts
HIV increases and peaks on 2004, and is slowly decreasing due to patients knowing they are HIV positive, understanding how to stop the spread and the use of Antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs
Non-disease death is road-injuries, self harm -> both are not decreasing
Some other high non-disease deaths are slowly going down
Exposure to nature has high peaks at 1991,2004,2008,2010 
    2010 - Haiti earthquake
    2008 - Cyclone nargis in Myanmar
    2004 - Indian ocean earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Somalia
    1991 - Bangladesh cyclone
High peak of Conflict and terrorism on 1994 - Rwanda genocide, 2014 war in Iraq and Syrian way (2011 start - 2017(end of violence))
