# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to create data visualizations on the Causes of Death dataset. Through visualizations, it is possible to look for trends and try to estimate their future values. By investigating interesting trends/outliers, it is possible to try and match them up with historic events and their effect on the population. 

## Process
1. Determine what kind of data was present
2. Categorize the data (Health vs Non-Health, Positive vs Negative trends)
3. Create line graphs between year and causes of death
4. Create maps showcasing the major causes of death and where they are located
5. Investigate the line graphs for any interesting trends/outliers
6. Research into the specific years of any interesting trends and correlate them with the data
7. Create dashboards to organize the visualizations
8. Combine the dashboards into a story

## Results
Chose option 2, dataset Causes of Death
Main Question: What is the main cause of death?
Sub questions: 
1. Is there a difference between health related and non-health related deaths
2. Will it still be increasing in the future?
3. Where are these deaths occurring?
4. Is it the main factor in all countries?

The main cause of death is seen to be from Cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms(cancer). These two variables had a high volume of deaths compared to the other causes of death. 

Line graphs were created to look for trends between the cause of death and year. It was seen that some causes of death was decreasing while others were increasing. The line graph showed spikes of activitiy indicating a large event happened that caused death to the population. This was seen on the Non-Health Related Causes of Death graph. 

Exposure to nature has high peaks during 1991,2004,2008,2010 
    2010 - Haiti earthquake
    2008 - Cyclone nargis in Myanmar
    2004 - Indian ocean earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Somalia
    1991 - Bangladesh cyclone

High peak of Conflict and terrorism: 
    1994 - Rwanda genocide, 2014 war in Iraq and Syrian war (2011 start - 2017(end of violence))

Another interesting trend to invevstigate was HIV as it was increasing in numbers but started to decrease around 2004. This could be due to awareness of the disease and understanding its mode of transmission. The introduction of antiretroviral therapy programs could also explain the decrease in numbers. 

Another type of graph used was a map plot that compared countries and their number of deaths due to a variable. It is seen that China and India are contributing the most to the number of deaths in the world. Depending on the cause of death (ex: HIV), other countries may be contributing a higher proportion of it compared to China and India. Overall, those two countries contribute a lot to the number of deaths, but for the smaller causes of death, other countries may be higher than China or India. 

The final type of graph used was a barplot. One of the purposes of this graph was to showcase the total number of deaths for a given variable and compare it to one another. This gave insight on which cause of death to investigate. The second purpose of this graph was to categorize and differentiate the types of death as health and non-health related. This showed that health holds a large number of deaths for the world. 


## Challenges 
The biggest challenge with this data set was trying to get visualizations that were not line graphs. The dataset was focussed on trends for the types of deaths for the countries in the world. 

## Future Goals
I would like to have found more data about population, age and gender to discover even more insights with the causes of death. Having more categorical data would help heighten the types of visualizations that can be made and determine some more information about each cause of death (age/gender factors).
